## Intro to Crypto Art for Artists and Collectors

Below you will find links to the pages and resources that will help you get started with the world of Crypto Art.

First, do you want to become a Cryptoartist?  If so, start with section 1.  If not, these may make interesting reading for 
potential collectors as well, and who knows, you might just joing the ranks of the Artist / Collectors in this space.

* [Can I become a Crypto Artist?](https://cryptoartschool.github.io/IntroCapsule/1.1-Can-I-become-a-Crypto-Artist)
* [You are now entering Unrealcity](https://cryptoartschool.github.io/IntroCapsule/1.2-You-Are-Now-Entering-Unrealcity)

Second, do you already have a wallet?  If so, skip section 2.  If not, read these pages to get things set up.

* [Setting up your wallet](https://cryptoartschool.github.io/IntroCapsule/2.1-Setting-up-your-wallet)
* [Funding your wallet](https://cryptoartschool.github.io/IntroCapsule/2.2-Funding-a-wallet)

Third, you might just think this is for artists, but collectors can also find it useful to know about what tools are 
being used, what the 'look' of each tool is, and how easy or difficult it is to achieve said effect.  For artists starting
with no digital art background, there are many apps and tutorials to help you get started.  If you are already a digital
artist, you can probably skip this step as you likely have work that is already ready to be tokenized.

Now we get to what sets Crypto Art NFTs (what we're making here) apart from other forms of digital art.  The tokens!
