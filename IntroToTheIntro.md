### Starting Off

First, do you want to become a Cryptoartist?  If so, start with this section.  If not, these may make interesting reading for 
potential collectors as well, and who knows, you might just join the ranks of the Artist / Collectors in this space.

* [Can I become a Crypto Artist?](https://cryptoartschool.github.io/IntroCapsule/1.1-Can-I-become-a-Crypto-Artist)
* [You are now entering Unrealcity](https://cryptoartschool.github.io/IntroCapsule/1.2-You-Are-Now-Entering-Unrealcity)

### Wallets

Second, do you already have a wallet?  If so, skip this section.  If not, read these pages to get things set up.

* [Setting up your wallet](https://cryptoartschool.github.io/IntroCapsule/2.1-Setting-up-your-wallet)
* [Funding your wallet](https://cryptoartschool.github.io/IntroCapsule/2.2-Funding-a-wallet)

### Essentials

Third, you'll want to know where to find Cryptoart, how to find out more about some of the other artists in this space, what kinds of different options there are for sales mechanics and auctions... All kinds of little things that it helps to know to get you creating and collecting confidently!

* [Little essentials](https://cryptoartschool.github.io/IntroCapsule/3.1-Little-essentials)

### Creation and Tools

Now, you might just think this next section is only for artists, but collectors can also find it useful to know about what 
tools are being used, what the 'look' of each tool is, and how easy or difficult it is to achieve said effect.  For artists starting with no digital art background, there are many apps and tutorials to help you get started.  If you are already a digital artist, check out some of the tools here and have a look at any you're unfamiliar with, see if any capture your
curiosity!

* [Creating your first piece of art](https://cryptoartschool.github.io/IntroCapsule/4.1-Creating-the-image-you-want-to-tokenize)
* [Tools tutorials](https://beta.cent.co/~cryptoartschool) -- sorry link no longer working, as Cent is no longer serving categories of posts it seems!  If I can find a fix, I will correct this.

### Tokenizing

Now we get to what sets Crypto Art NFTs (what we're making here) apart from other forms of digital art; the tokens!

* [Tokenizing (minting) your work](https://cryptoartschool.github.io/IntroCapsule/4.2-Tokenizing-your-work)


### Credit

Once you have completed all of the above steps, you can apply for credit for this course:
