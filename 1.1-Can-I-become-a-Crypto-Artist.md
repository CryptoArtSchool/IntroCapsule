## The simple answer is **YES**!  You can.

Whether you are new to digital art, new to crytpo, or new to it all.  Doing the steps outlined in this 
Intro Capsule will not only introduce you to some of the basic things you need to know, but also walk you through to creating 
your very first tokenized artwork - everyone, even collectors, should do this at least once!

There are some hoops to jump through, sure. As the space is quite new and not everything is quite as 
joined up as it could be, but if you are willing to give it some of your time, the rewards are well worth it!

See what a relatively new crypto artist 
[has to say about their experiences](https://cryptoartschool.github.io/IntroCapsule/1.2-You-Are-Now-Entering-Unrealcity) 
to see if it is the right choice for you.
