Make sure you have completed the steps outlined in [2.1 Setting up your wallet](https://github.com/SparrowGlobal/DiscoveryZone/wiki/2.1-Setting-up-your-wallet)

Instructions for sending funds to your wallet will also vary widely based on whether you already have ETH or whether you need to buy your first ETH tokens.

For those who already have a dollar or two of ETH (say in their wallet on Cent) you can send that to the wallet you want to use to mint your tokens (MetaMask or Trust were the examples we provided) by following the instructions on the [Cent help page](https://intercom.help/cent/en/articles/2613082-cent-wallet) for setting up and adding additional wallets to your account there.  You can even use your account on Cent to easily [add funds to your wallet](https://beta.cent.co/+s0uzem).

If you don't have any ETH anywhere, [sign up to Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/signup) or the exchange of your choice. Coinbase probably provides the widest coverage for countries around the world. Follow their instructions for purchasing ETH. Then follow the [instructions provided by MetaMask](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028141672-How-to-send-deposit-tokens-to-your-MetaMask-Wallet) to transfer the funds from Coinbase (or other exchange) to your wallet for minting.

This may seem like quite a few hoops to jump through, and it is.  But then, if it were a quick and easy thing, everyone would be doing it and you'd lose your advantage of being early to the playing field!
