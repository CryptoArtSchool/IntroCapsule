Make sure you have completed the steps outlined in [2.1 Setting up your wallet](https://cryptoartschool.github.com/IntroCapsule/2.1-Setting-up-your-wallet)

Instructions for sending funds to your wallet will vary widely based on whether you already have ETH somewhere or whether you need to buy your first ETH tokens.

For those who already have a dollar or two of ETH (say in their wallet on Cent) you can transfer that to the wallet you want to use to mint your tokens (MetaMask if you are following the example here) by following the instructions on the [Cent help page](https://intercom.help/cent/en/articles/2613082-cent-wallet) for setting up and adding additional wallets to your account there.  You can even use your account on Cent to easily [add funds to your wallet](https://beta.cent.co/+s0uzem).

If you don't have any ETH anywhere, [sign up to Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/signup) or the exchange of your choice. Coinbase probably provides the widest coverage for countries around the world. Follow their instructions for purchasing ETH. Then follow the [instructions provided by MetaMask](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028141672-How-to-send-deposit-tokens-to-your-MetaMask-Wallet) to transfer the funds from Coinbase (or other exchange) to your wallet for minting.

This may seem like quite a few hoops to jump through, and it is.  But then, if it were a quick and easy thing, everyone would be doing it and you'd lose your advantage of being early to the playing field! Remember 90% of people do not get past this phase!  However, once this one-time set up is done, and you have a web3 wallet that you'll use to login to the various Cryptoart platforms, this will all operate pretty seemlessly.  You are almost there!

If you're all ready to go ahead and get creating & minting, then move right along to [4.1 Creating the image you want to tokenize](https://cryptoartschool.github.com/IntroCapsule/4.1-Creating-the-image-you-want-to-tokenize) and get started creating!
