Now that you have [minted your first token](https://aryptoartschool.github.com/IntroCapsule/Tokenizing-your-work), anyone can view and verify that token on OpenSea thanks to the [ERC721 standard that all NFTs conform to](https://opensea.io/blog/guides/non-fungible-tokens/).

To do this, follow these steps:

1. Go to https://opensea.io/ and connect with your wallet.

2. On the 'In Wallet' tab on that site, you should see your newly tokenized artwork (and any other NFTs you may own).

3. Click on the image and it will show you details of the metadata associated with your token.

4. If you send me a link to the OpenSea page of your piece to show you've completed this course, I will send an NFT badge confirming your completion of this Intro Capsule to the address that owns that token.  

5. Having this badge in your wallet will allow you to take other courses added to the Art School.
