Now that your wallets are [all set up](https://cryptoartschool.github.com/IntroCapsule/2.1-Setting-up-your-wallet) and [funded](https://cryptoartschool.github.com/IntroCapsule/2.2-Funding-a-wallet), you're ready to create the image you want to tokenize.  if you already have an image!  Great!  Use that.

If not, and you're interested in some free tools that can be helpful in creating your art, the list below are just some of the options:

* [Glitch Lab](https://download.cnet.com/Glitch-Lab/3000-12511_4-78213603.html) is a great place to start to see how you can manipulate your images in interesting ways. There are a whole lot of [Glitch Lab tututorials on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnfdj-gV14N5JTGybk4kkVpyL_7dT_jcS)
* Mirror Lab is another app by the same developer and offers a different range of edits and effects. You can see some of the effects you can achieve in this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR1COePHz1c).
* Pixaloop is another fun app for your phone that allows you to add motion to your images (and other cool effects).  There are (some) [tutorials for this on YouTube](DIrwVjoSBR4)

If you'd prefer to use your computer rather than your phone or tablet, I highly recommend:
* [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) for all of your image creation or editing needs.  There are [tutorials](https://www.gimp.org/tutorials/) that will walk you through everything from beginner to advanced techniques.
* For 3D images, by far the best free tool is [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) and again, there are extensive [tutorials and courses](https://cloud.blender.org/courses) for Blender as well as [YouTube videos](https://youtu.be/0hm7cpBn2xI) pointing to some of the best channels available for tutorials there. You could very well spend the rest of your life perfecting your Blender techniques!!

I hope this is enough to get you started and get you playing with a few of the many tools that are readily available to digital artists today. Remember, there are also really good tutorials on various tools and techniques in the [#cryptoartschool channel on Cent](https://beta.cent.co/~cryptoartschool) 

Once you have an image that you are happy with and want to tokenize, you're ready for the next step: [4.2 Tokenizing your work](https://cryptoartschool.github.com/IntroCapsule/4.1-Tokenizing-your-work), AKA 'minting'.
