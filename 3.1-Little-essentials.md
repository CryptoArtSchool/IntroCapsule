One defining factor of Cryptoart is its decentralized nature.  While not all things can be said to be purely decentralised, it is a theme running through the entire space, as well as a promise of the underlying blockchain technology.  So here, we'll
look at a variety of things that make up the "Crypto Art Space" and help you get familiar with things you may encounter along
your journey into Crypto Art!

First of all, there is not just one style of art, there is not just one platform, or one kind of token, or one smart contract, or one central list of things "cryptoart" - it is made up of any and all of these, and many of them change over time.  In my own opinion, this is a good thing - as it contributes to the resiliency of the overall space.  Artists may come and go, platforms may come and go, new smart contracts get created, heck, even whole blockchains can change, but the spirit and the movement that is Cryptoart will continue on.

With that in mind, the following information is provided as a short list of pointers, not complete by any means, but a start.
Getting involved and interating with the community is highly recommended and you will quickly move beyond these basics to
a fuller understanding of the space as a whole, or dive deep into one and create a niche for yourself.  Whichever works for
you, there is room for anyone and everyone. These are just a few things to get you started off!
