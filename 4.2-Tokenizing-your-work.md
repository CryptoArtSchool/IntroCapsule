Now that you have an image that you would like to tokenize on the blockchain and sell, we are going to jump back to Mintbase to create our first token.

I chose Mintbase to use in this example because it allows anyone to create their own contract with their own tokens and begin tokenizing their art.  No need to ask anyone's permission or wait for an application to be approved. There are advantages and disadvantages to having your own contract and token and we discuss these in the [month-long artist module on creating Crypto Art which will be rolled out later this year](https://github.com/SparrowGlobal/DiscoveryZone/wiki/Crypto-Art-School).

The other reason I chose Mintbase was it took quite a lot of the work away from me!  They have great step-by-step guides that walk you through the process of creating your tokens using their site.

Before you can create a token, you have to have a contract that owns & manages the tokens. How to do that is documented [here](https://docs.mintbase.io/getting-started/creating-a-smart-contract).

Finally, you mint the token for the image by following [these instructions](https://docs.mintbase.io/getting-started/minting).

And there you have it!  You've minted your first NFT!
